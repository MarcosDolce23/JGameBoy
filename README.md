## Comments
I know the code is a mess and it doesn't work very well, but I'm trying to do the best I can on this.
I started doing all by myself, but soon I realized that it was too complex to understand the ppu and the apu
so I ended up porting the nectarboy's Pollem Boy which is written on javaScript which, is more familiar to me.

```
So thank you very much nectarboy! I learned a lot copying you :)
